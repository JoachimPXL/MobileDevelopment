Note: the source file with rules was taken from file
[git-deny-patterns.json](https://github.com/jandre/safe-commit-hook/blob/master/git-deny-patterns.json)
from repo [jandre/safe-commit-hook](https://github.com/jandre/safe-commit-hook) on Dec 2015.

## Motivation

Can you accidentally add `id_rsa` file to your Github? Sure!
But remember, it will be [very hard](https://help.github.com/articles/remove-sensitive-data/) to remove
traces of them later. [Most popular NPM packages have leaked sensitive information by mistake][1].

Wouldn't be easier to never commit files that should not be committed in the first place?
This project is a easy to use CLI or git pre-commit hook filter that will scrape modified or added
filenames to make sure they do not match widely common patterns (`.pem`, etc.)

For example, here is `ban` in action - stopping me from adding NPM registry `_authToken` to
`.npmrc` file

## Install

Add to your project `npm install --save-dev ban-sensitive-files`

## Use

* From the command line `node --harmony node_modules/.bin/ban` when you have any staged files 
  to check their filenames.

* From NPM script

```json
"scripts": {
  "ban": "ban"
}
```

Then run `npm run ban` to check modified, added or deleted filenames.
You can check ALL repo filenames again by adding command line flag `-f` to form the full command
`npm run ban -- -f`.

* When using from other Git hook projects, for example from [pre-git](https://github.com/bahmutov/pre-git),
  first, add "ban" NPM script command, then add to the `pre-commit` command list

```json
"config": {
  "pre-git": {
    "pre-commit": [
      "npm test",
      "npm run ban"
    ]
  }
}
```

* When using from a CI you probably want to check all files in the repo, not just
the changed ones. Pass `-f` or `--all` option. Example Travis file

```yaml
script:
  - npm run ban -- --all
  - npm test
```

## Note about --harmony flag

If the CI has troubles running `node --harmony` scripts, set the "ban" script to be the full
node command

```json
"scripts": {
  "ban": "node --harmony node_modules/.bin/ban"
}
```

## Use as a module

You can use the checker from another module

```js
var isBanned = require('ban-sensitive-files');
isBanned('path/file/name');
// checks single file, returns true or false
// prints any errors to console.error
isBanned(['name1', 'name2', 'name3']);
// checks list of files
isBanned('file/name', logger);
// use provided logger function instead of console.error
```

## Advanced

To figure out what the script is doing, enable debug logging

    DEBUG=ban npm run ban
