There are numerous ways to "shoot yourself in the foot" using `npm publish`. The purpose of this module is to replace
`npm publish` for your packages with safe and more functional alternative, which will allow you to:

 - Run tests or build steps before publishing (because `prepublish` is [broken](https://medium.com/greenkeeper-blog/what-is-npm-s-prepublish-and-why-is-it-so-confusing-a948373e6be1#.a40w9sdy6)).
 - Perform check for the [sensitive data](#sensitive-information-audit) in your package to be sure that you didn't leak it by accident (Further reading: [Do not underestimate credentials leaks](https://github.com/ChALkeR/notes/blob/master/Do-not-underestimate-credentials-leaks.md)).
 - Perform check for vulnerable dependencies using [Node Security Project](https://nodesecurity.io/) data.
 - Check that you are in the correct git branch.
 - Check that git tag matches version specified in the `package.json`.
 - Check that there are no uncommitted changes in the working tree.
 - Check that there are no untracked files in the working tree.
 - Force usage of the [npm publish tag](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/publish) there necessary, so you'll be sure you're not publishing preview version of your package as a release version.
 - Get release summary and publishing confirmation.
 - Configure publishing using built-in configuration wizard.

## Getting started
Setup process of *publish-please* is quite trivial - just run
```shell
npm install --save-dev publish-please
```
in your project's directory.

Once it finish installing, *publish-please* will automatically run it's configuration wizard, which will guide you
through some simple steps to setup [features](#options) you want to use:

![config](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/inikulin/publish-please/master/media/config.png)

If you forgot to configure something or just changed your mind and want to change configuration, just run
```shell
npm run publish-please config
```
to return to wizard.

So, once you've done with wizard from now on `npm publish` for your package is disabled (Muahahaha :smiling_imp:):

![guard](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/inikulin/publish-please/master/media/guard.png)

But don't worry it's done for the good reason to prevent you or your co-workers run unsafe publishing process. Use awesome version
instead:
```shell
npm run publish-please
```


## Options

 - **prePublishScript** - Specifies command that will be run before publish (e.g. `npm test`). Use it for builds and tests. Default: `npm test`.
 - **postPublishScript** - Specifies command that will be run after successful publishing. Use it for release announcements, creating a GitHub release, uploading binaries, etc. Default: `` (no command).
 - **publishTag** - Specifies tag with which package will be published. See [npm publish docs](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/publish) for more info. Default: `latest`.
 - **confirm** - Ask for the confirmation before publishing. Default: `true`.

### Validations
 - **uncommittedChanges** - Check that there are no uncommitted changes in the working tree. Default: `true`.
 - **untrackedFiles** - Check that there are no untracked files in the working tree. Default: `true`.
 - **gitTag** - Check that git tag matches version specified in the `package.json`. Default: `true`.
 - **branch** - Check that current branch matches the specified branch. Default: `master`.
 - **sensitiveData** - Perform [audit for the sensitive data](#sensitive-information-audit). Default: `true`.
 - **vulnerableDependencies** - Perform vulnerable dependencies check using [Node Security Project](https://nodesecurity.io/) data. Default: `true`.


## Sensitive information audit
**Important note:** tool provides some very basic sensitive data check. Do not rely on it fully. Always perform manual checks for the
sensitive data in your packages.
